INTRODUCTION
WEB PATTERNS SEARCH IS MAINLY ENTITY BASED
Evaluation techniques measure quality of retrieved docs, same might be happening with entity linking, measuring the quality of links
An argument is to be made that long-tail entities are becoming more and more important

Entity linking can lead to improval of tasks such as summarisation, search, classification
More specifically search as an example: 64% of queries are unique -> entity linking can be used to group queries under a particular entity
But for this, recall must be improved, more focus on new entities

The EL linking task has been growing considerably
focusing on broadening scope
Broader scope = sparser set of entities to recognize
is there > long-tail ? 
This is thought to be dependent of the dataset, and therefore, analysis on real big data is required to answer the question.

abstract = "Named Entity Linking (nel) grounds entity mentions to their corresponding node in a Knowledge Base (kb). Recently, a number of systems have been proposed for linking entity mentions in text to Wikipedia pages. Such systems typically search for candidate entities and then disambiguate them, returning either the best candidate or nil. However, comparison has focused on disambiguation accuracy, making it difficult to determine how search impacts performance. Furthermore, important approaches from the literature have not been systematically compared on standard data sets. We reimplement three seminal nel systems and present a detailed evaluation of search strategies. Our experiments find that coreference and acronym handling lead to substantial improvement, and search strategies account for much of the variation between systems. This is an interesting finding, because these aspects of the problem have often been neglected in the literature, which has focused largely on complex candidate ranking algorithms."

This goes at the end of entity linking intro right before NIL vs long-tail
Challenges of entity linking
The main challenges arise from
word ambiguities inherent to natural language: surface form
synonymy, i.e., different spans of text referring to the same
entity, and homonymy, i.e., the same name being shared by
multiple entities.
Another example of probabilistic approaches => doesn't solve the problem of the heavy tail
Concluded they want to expand getting from more info sources in order to enrich the probabilistic model
The problem is when entities are new
