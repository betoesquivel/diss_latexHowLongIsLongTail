The growth of unstructured textual information available online has attracted the attention of the Natural Language Processing (NLP) research community.
Since the advent of the internet, plenty of research has been done on the area of Information Extraction (IE) from text,
and whenever an IE problem is established by the community, work usually starts with extracting entities from text.

The process of recognizing entities (Entity Recognition) and linking them (Entity Linking) to structured repositories of information in text
is a common preceding step before many Information Extraction tasks.
For instance, search is a good example of this, where over 70\% of searches or queries are entity-based or at least keyword-based \cite{webpatterns},
and around 64\% of queries tend to be unique.
In this case, grouping queries becomes a hard problem because they are so different or, better said, the set of queries is sparse.
Therefore, an improvement on the identification of entities in queries would mean an overall improvement on the search task,
since queries could be grouped by entity or entity type.

Also, this task has recently become highly relevant in the commercial environment, with many companies trying to make sense of their unstructured textual data
in order to gain some insight that may yield a competitive advantage;
information extraction and text analytics has even become a popular area for startup businesses to compete in \cite{techcrunch, ventureradar},
with even the big companies in the industry (Apple, Google, Microsoft, Yahoo, ...) all participating with their own products that leverage IE technologies and research.
