This section will mainly focus on describing the core concepts behind Entity Linking, the current state-of-the art implementation for solving this task, and how it struggles to classify a particular set of entities, which is the main focus of this paper, Long-tail Entities.
It will also briefly describe the task of Entity Recognition, which commonly precedes Entity Linking and is the basis for the approaches used in this paper to describe the set of Long-tail Entities.

Entity Linking is an Information Extraction (IE) process by which named entities in text are identified and linked to a "corresponding node in a Knowledge Base"\cite{rw_elo_HACHEY2013130}. 

The first step in this task, identifying Named Entities, belongs to a category of its own, Named Entity Recognition (NER).
\cite{rw_elo_Nadeau2009} best describes the purpose of this task as the identification of entities with "rigid designators",
such as proper names and terms. Work in this area classifies Entities mostly using the collection of types known as "enamex": persons, locations and organizations \cite{rw_elo_Nadeau2009},
; the most commonly used methods to do this been statistical approaches.
Two popular examples of statistical approaches to NER been the software packages: Stanford Named Entity Recognizer\cite{rw_elo_finkel2005} and Apache OpenNLP\cite{rw_elo_kottmann2011};
both of which play an important role in this paper. Stanford NER is used in this research as the default tagger for identifying Named Entities.

On the other hand, Apache OpenNLP is used in the underlying algorithm for "spotting" candidate Named Entities to link to Wikipedia by DBPedia Spotlight\cite{rw_elo_isem2013daiber},
which is amongst the state-of-the-art methods for performing entity linking. \cite{rw_elo_isem2013daiber}, like other approaches to Entity Linking, outputs a set of entitites or "spots" tagged with, either a link to an entry in DBPedia\cite{rw_elo_morsey2012dbpedia}, or the "nil" tag \cite{rw_elo_HACHEY2013130}. 

%% describe dbpedias algorithm

The statistical nature of the algorithm, in addition to the usage of DBPedia as a Knowledge Base, means that uncommon mentions in text are bound to be hard to link to DBPedia. This paper focuses on identifying and describing the cases on which the infrequency with which an entity is mentioned in text leads to incorrect linking of entities, and the size of this set of cases.

\subsection{Infrastructure requirements for entity linking}
% Ways of using entity linkers at the moment. Use their REST service or deploy your own. 
% Memory requirements
%% How is this related: Difficult to conduct research without knowledge of infrastructure cluster management or a server that satisfies this requirements. 
%% How I build on this: Build a system that uses Cloud-based technologies for tagging data and querying the results. 
\subsection{NIL Entities versus Long-tail Entities}
% How are NIL Entities described in current papers.
% What work is been done with them at the moment.
%% Justification of differentiating between NIL Entities and Long-tail Entities
%% Long-tail entities are specific to their domain. They must be identified isolated within their domain.
%% Commercial relevance of Long-tail entities suggestion (show commercial applications that do Long-tail entity recognition)
%% Describing and measuring the set of Long-tail entities allows businesses who benefit from IE tasks to decide if they will benefit from performing more granular IE tasks, which can be expensive (supervised learning of Long-tail entities requires labeling of data) to identify Long-tail entities.
